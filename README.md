This is a Kotlin Multiplatform line-by-line transliteration port of [`rust-lang/socket2`](https://github.com/rust-lang/socket2).

**Original Project:** This port is based on [`rust-lang/socket2`](https://github.com/rust-lang/socket2). All design credit and project intent belong to the upstream authors; this repository is a faithful port to Kotlin Multiplatform with no behavioural changes intended.

### Porting status

This is an **in-progress port**. The goal is feature parity with the upstream Rust crate while providing a native Kotlin Multiplatform API. Every Kotlin file carries a `// port-lint: source <path>` header naming its upstream Rust counterpart so the AST-distance tool can track provenance.

## Upstream README — `rust-lang/socket2`

> The text below is reproduced and lightly edited from [`https://github.com/rust-lang/socket2`](https://github.com/rust-lang/socket2). It is the upstream project's own description and remains under the upstream authors' authorship; links have been rewritten to absolute upstream URLs so they continue to resolve from this repository.

## Socket2

Socket2 is a crate that provides utilities for creating and using sockets.

The goal of this crate is to create and use a socket using advanced
configuration options (those that are not available in the types in the standard
library) without using any unsafe code.

This crate provides as direct as possible access to the system's functionality
for sockets, this means little effort to provide cross-platform utilities. It is
up to the user to know how to use sockets when using this crate. *If you don't
know how to create a socket using libc/system calls then this crate is not for
you*. Most, if not all, functions directly relate to the equivalent system call
with no error handling applied, so no handling errors such as `EINTR`. As a
result using this crate can be a little wordy, but it should give you maximal
flexibility over configuration of sockets.

See the [API documentation] for more.

# Branches

Currently Socket2 supports the following versions:
 * v0.6 developed in the master branch
 * v0.5 developed in the [v0.5.x branch]
 * v0.4 developed in the [v0.4.x branch]

[v0.5.x branch]: https://github.com/rust-lang/socket2/tree/v0.5.x
[v0.4.x branch]: https://github.com/rust-lang/socket2/tree/v0.4.x

# OS support

Socket2 attempts to support the same OS/architectures as Rust does, see
https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html. However this is
not always possible, below is current list of support OSs.

*If your favorite OS is not on the list consider contributing it!*

### Tier 1

These OSs are tested with each commit in the CI and must always pass the tests.
All functions/types/etc., excluding ones behind the `all` feature, must work on
these OSs.

* Linux
* macOS
* Windows

### Tier 2

These OSs are currently build in the CI, but not tested. Not all
functions/types/etc. may work on these OSs, even ones **not** behind the `all`
feature flag.

* Android
* FreeBSD
* Fuchsia
* iOS
* illumos
* NetBSD
* Redox
* Solaris
* OpenHarmony

# Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

Socket2 uses 1.70.0 as MSRV.
